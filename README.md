Notes:
* 2.80 - 2.91 are previous stable releases.
* 2.83 is the first Blender LTS release. Check the `blender-v2.83-release` branch.
* 2.92 is the current stable release. Check the `blender-v2.92-release` branch.
* master branch of this addon is mirrored in [Blender Addons master](https://developer.blender.org/diffusion/BA/browse/master/io_scene_gltf2/), that will become 2.93.

### Legacy 2.79 Support

The final version of this addon with legacy support for Blender 2.79 is available on the [2.79 Release Page](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Blender-IO/releases/tag/2.79).

Blender 2.80 and higher bundle this addon in the main Blender install package, so no 3rd-party install is required.

Introduction
------------

Official Khronos Group Blender [glTF](https://www.khronos.org/gltf/) 2.0 importer and exporter.  

This project contains all features from the [previous exporter](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Blender-Exporter), and all future development will happen on this repository. In addition, this repository contains a Blender importer, with common Python code shared between exporter and importer for round-trip workflows. New features are included or under development, but usage and menu functionality remain the same.

The shared codebase is organized into common (Blender-independent) and Blender-specific packages:

Package organisation  

This structure allows common code to be reused by third-party Python packages working with the glTF 2.0 format.

Import & export process

The main importer and exporter interface is the Python glTF scene representation.  
Blender scene data is first extracted and converted into this scene description. This glTF scene description is exported to the final JSON glTF file. Any compression of mesh, animation, or texture data happens here.  
For import, glTF data is parsed and written into the Python glTF scene description. Any decompression is executed in this step. Using the imported glTF scene tree, the Blender internal scene representation is generated from this information.

Installation
------------

The Khronos glTF 2.0 importer and exporter is enabled by default in [Blender 2.8](https://www.blender.org/2-8/) and higher. To reinstall it — for example, when testing recent or upcoming changes — copy the `addons/io_scene_gltf2` folder into the `scripts/addons/` directory of the Blender installation, then enable it under the *Add-ons* tab. For additional development documentation, see [Debugging](DEBUGGING.md).

Debugging
---------

- [Debug with PyCharm](https://code.blender.org/2015/10/debugging-python-code-with-pycharm) **NOTE:** If you are using Blender 2.80, you need the [updated debugger script](https://github.com/ux3d/random-blender-addons/blob/master/remote_debugger.py)
- [Debug with VSCode](DEBUGGING.md)

Continuous Integration Tests
----------------------------

Several companies, individuals, and glTF community members contribute to Blender glTF I/O. Functionality is added and bugs are fixed regularly. Because hobbyists and professionals using Blender glTF I/O rely on its stability for their daily work, continuous integration tests are enabled. After each commit or pull request, the following tests are run:

-	Export Blender scene and validate using the [glTF validator](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Validator/)
-	Round trip import-export and comparison of glTF validator results  

These quality-assurance checks improve the reliability of Blender glTF I/O.

Running the Tests Locally
-------------------------

To run the tests locally, your system should have a `blender` executable in the path that launches the desired version of Blender.

The latest version of [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) should also be installed.

Then, in the `tests` folder of this repository, run `yarn install`, followed by `yarn run test`.
